# Pixelmatters - Git Bisect Example

This repository holds a simple example application to showcase the use of [`git bisect`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) command.

To know more, please visit our [blog post](https://pixelmatters.com/blog) about it.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
pnpm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
